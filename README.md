## Scope of the project.

In this repo, you can find some problems from [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com "Hacker Rank"). This repo is organized by language, each problem contains the statement (in pdf) and the code (solution). I have chosen those problems because, in my opinion, them contains features that can be found in other problems in productive environments. 

I haven't included the venvs (for Python scripts), neither exe files (for C scripts).

I want to keep near those problems to me in case of Tech interviews or the like. Also, I want to share them to the comunity.
